# Python_ABM_crashcourse
Python-based crash course in agent-based modeling

## Lecture 1:
This lecture introduces multicellular systems and agent-based approaches that simulate cells as software objects that "live" in a chemical environment. It then builds a basic agent-based model framework by (1) introducing Python classes, (2) building an `Environment` class with diffusion/decay, and (3) building a `Cell` class with basic cell-cell mechanics, birth/death, and coupling to the chemical environment.

## Lecture 2: 
This lecture turns its attention to PhysiCell, a more developed agent-based modeling framework. After showing some research examples, we perform a hands-on exploration of cloud-hosted PhysiCell models.
